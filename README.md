# MAPest

MAPest (Maximun-A-Posteriori estimation) is a probabilistic tool for estimating dynamics variables in humans.

The code in this repository works only *off-line* and to solve the problem of the estimation of human dynamics you need to have a dataset of different measurements coming from sensors.
For the moment the repository consists of two type of experiments:
  1. **1st experiment** (2dofBowingTask): where we consider a very simplified human model with 3 link and 2 Dofs and a sensor architecture composed by the Vicon motion capture + an IMU + one forceplate; 
  2. **2nd experiment** (23links_human): where the model is composed by 23 links and for the sensor structure by the Xsens suit + two sensorized shoes.
  
Detailes on the experiments in the README of each related Section.
