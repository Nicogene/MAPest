# MAPest

MAPest (Maximun-A-Posteriori estimation) is a probabilistic tool for estimating dynamics variables in humans. A detailed theoretical description in the paper:

**Latella, C.; Traversaro, S.; Ferigo, D.; Tirupachuri, Y.; Rapetti, L.; Andrade Chavez, F.J.; Nori, F.; Pucci, D. Simultaneous Floating-Base Estimation of Human Kinematics and Joint Torques. Sensors 2019, 19, 2794**, https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/19/12/2794

and in the thesis:

**Latella, C. Human Whole-Body Dynamics Estimation for Enhancing Physical Human-Robot Interaction**, https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.01136

The code in this repository works only *off-line* and to solve the problem of the estimation of human dynamics you need to have a dataset of different measurements coming from sensors.
